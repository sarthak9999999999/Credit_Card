# Credit_Card

BUILD VERSION: 1.0

-> This Build Contains a UI of a Payment System of Credit Cards supporting various credit cards

-> Asks for Credit Card Number,Expiry Date,CVV,First Name and Last Name.

-> Verifies for each user input and warns user accordingly

-> Each case has been closely taken into consideration so that the app doesnt crash

-> After clicking the submit button the logic checks the validity of all input fields,if all goes well it asks
   for a confirmation from the user.
   
-> If the user taps on Yes, a Bottom Fragment pops up with a Payment Successful Message

-> If the user taps on No,It goes back to the UI

The design has been kept simple of the Screen as a Payment Activity should look like.
